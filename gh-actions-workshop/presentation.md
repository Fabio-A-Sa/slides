### What is CI/CD - an introduction

.question[
A quick question before we start...

Does anyone here know what **CI/CD** is?
]

<br />

--

- *CI/CD* = *Continuous Integration* + *Continuous Delivery*

--

- *CI/CD* is not having to build my code manually

--

- *CI/CD* is not having to deploy my code manually

--

- *CI/CD* is about being more confident in the code I write and push to GitHub

---

### What is CI/CD - an introduction

To put it simply, CI/CD combines the practices of 
**continuous integration** and **continuous delivery**. It's about **automating** much 
of the process of getting new code to users: by **testing**, **building** and **deploying**.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content:center;">
<img src="./assets/ci-cd.webp" width=500>
</div>

--

.question[
For the audience...
  
Why are continuous processes important?
]

---

### Difference between CI and CD

--

**Integration** is "the action or process of combining two or more things in an effective way", ([Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/integration)).

--

.question[
Based on this...  

What do we need to perform an integration?
]

--

- Create, ...

--

- ..., Combine, ...

--
  
- ..., and Ensure Quality.

--

The act of doing this continuously is called **Continuous Integration**. It's about:

--

  - continuously creating new code and adding it to the codebase

--

  - ensuring that the codebase remains in a workable and functioning state

---

### Common CI activities

Here are some examples of **common *CI* activities**:

--

  - Build the code

--

  - Perform static code analysis

--

  - Format the code (or just check formatting)

--

  - Run tests (unit testing, integration testing, ...)

--

  - Report code coverage

<div style="display: flex; justify-content:center;">
<img src="./assets/ci-cd.webp" width=500>
</div>
  
---

### Difference between CI and CD

**Delivery** is "the act of taking goods, letters, parcels, etc. to people's houses or places of work", ([Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/delivery)). In this case, we're delivering software!

.question[
Based on this...

What do we need to deliver a software? For instance, what would you have to do to deliver an Android application? 
]

--

- Package, ...

--

- ..., Distribute, ...

--

- ..., Execute, ... *(not applicable to Android apps)*

--

- ..., and Monitor.

--

.question[
For the audience...

Why is monitoring important?
]

--

- Gather real-world information like, performance, usability, ...
- Detect problems early and fix them before they become bigger problems.

---

### Common CD activities

Here are some examples of **common *CD* activities**:

--

  - Packaging the code

--

  - Deploying to QA environments

--

  - Uploading the package to a registry (Play Store, ...)

--

  - Error monitoring

--
  
  - After **manual approval**, deploying to production environment


<div style="display: flex; justify-content:center;">
<img src="./assets/ci-cd.webp" width=500>
</div>
  


---

### Continuous Deployment

**Continuous Deployment** is the same as *continuous delivery* but taken a step further and **automating** the release of the software to the **production environment**, whenever new changes are introduced and certain criteria are met.


**NOTE:** you don't need to implement all of these processes, it depends on the requirements of your project.


<div style="display: flex; justify-content:center;">
<img src="./assets/pipeline.png" width=500>
</div>

---

### Why should you include a CI/CD in your project?

- **Improved productivity**: With proper testing, the review time of each change is significantly reduced and also frees up your time from testing your project manually;
- **Fix bugs faster**: When using _CD_, monitoring allows you to understand when problems happen in near real-time; also, having a QA environment helps!
- **Reduced Risk**: By having a proper testing suite and by using *CI*, you can be confident that your changes will work when your code is deployed;
- And many other advantages that are not relevant in this context :)

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline takes some time, but sometimes you have to lose time now to **gain** time in the future.

---

### "Requirements" when using CI/CD

Having a proper _Git_ process that allows for parallel work and has small meaningful commits is very important for a CI/CD process to be effective, for example:

- [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
- [Trunk based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/)

For **CI**, it is also essential to have a way to properly **validate** your project, by having:

- Formatting
- Static code analysis
- Unit testing
- Integration testing

---

## CI/CD Pipelines

Normally, CI/CD processes are implemented using **pipelines**, which are a *series of steps that are executed in order*.
There are many systems designed to execute pipelines, but the most common ones are:

- **GitHub Actions** (free for public repositories; monthly allowance for private repositories, paid when you surpass the limit);
- **GitLab Pipelines** (400 compute minutes for free, paid if you wish to use their runners);
- **Jenkins** (open source, need to bring your own infrastructure, harder to learn);
- **CircleCI** (6000 minutes for free, need to upgrade for more)

## GitHub Actions

### Now we're getting to the fun part ;)

---

### GitHub Actions - Syntax

Every _workflow_ (equivalent to a pipeline) file is based on the YAML configuration syntax (indentation is required, just like Python). _Workflow_ files need to be in the `.github/workflows` folder to work.

.muted[.mono[.github/workflows/ansible-lint.yml]]
```yaml
name: "Lint ansible files"
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  lint: # Any name you want
    name: Ansible Lint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run ansible-lint
        uses: ansible/ansible-lint@main # or version tag instead of 'main'
        
      - name: Upload sarif
        if: always()
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
        with:
         sarif_file: ansible.sarif
         category: ansible-lint
```

---

### GitHub Actions - Events

A _workflow_ can be triggered by a plentitude of events:

- `push` or `pull_request` are the most common (listens for branch pushes or to PR events);
- `create` or `delete` listen for branch creation/deletion events;
- `workflow_call`, `workflow_dispatch`, and `workflow_run` can chain together _workflows_ via API or by specifying dependencies;
- the `schedule` can make a _workflow_ work on a recurrent basis using _cron job_ syntax.
- There's a [huge number of events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows) that can automate almost everything ranging from issues, comments or even automating GitHub Projects.

You can automate almost everything in GitHub, the sky is the limit üöÄ

---

### GitHub Actions - Jobs

A _workflow_ run is defined as one or multiple _jobs_, that run in parallel by default unless you define dependencies between them. A _job_ is then defined by one or multiple _steps_ that can be either **shell commands**, an **action from the _GitHub Marketplace_**, or a **custom action**.

You should also define what type of machine the job will run on, there's multiple types that GitHub can offer:

- **GitHub-hosted runner** (`macos-latest`, `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`)
- **Large-runners** (they have fewer limitations compared to the hosted runners for example, they can run Android emulators, etc...)
- **Self-hosted runners** (you can add your servers into your repository/organization, and have freedom on what you can run)

---

### GitHub Actions - Jobs Example

```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
    name: First job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hello World!"
  job2:
    name: Second job
    run-on: macos-latest
    needs: job1
    steps:
      - run: echo "A UNI √© a melhor APP"
  job3:
    name: Third job
    run-on: macos-latest
    if: ${{2 > 1}} #you can call jobs conditionally
    needs:
      - job1
      - job2
    steps:
      - run: echo "Bye!"
```

---

### GitHub Actions - Steps

As said previously _steps_ can be just a **shell command** or you can use other actions. You can make your Actions by programming them in **Javascript**, by using **Docker containers** or by defining them using **YAML** in the .mono[.github/actions/] folder of your repository.

We will not get very in-depth on Action creation but you can consult the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions) later.

```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
    name: First job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
     # community action to automatically download the
     # workflow repo in the correct branch
     - uses: actions/checkout@v4
     - run: echo "Hello World!"
    - uses: LuisDuarte1/semver-bump-environment@v1.0.0
      # you can also define IDs to access the
      # action outputs later
      id: bump-beta-version
      with:
        current_environment: staging
        production_version: '1.2.0'
        staging_version: '1.2.0-beta.1'
        bump_type: prerelease
```

---

### GitHub Actions - Contexts

Certain types of events define a default _context_ information for that type of event. The most common _context_ is the `github` context, where you can access related metadata about the action itself, or even more importantly the **commit SHA** (`github.sha`) or the **branch** that triggered the \_workflow\_\_ (`github.ref`).

There are other contexts you can access:

- **env** (contains variables set in a workflow, job, or step)
- **secrets** (contains the values of secrets that are available on that workflow)
- **matrix** (contains properties defined in a _matrix_)
- [and many other contexts...](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#about-contexts)

---

### GitHub Actions - Contexts Example

You can access contexts using the expression syntax `${{ <context> }}`:

```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "${{ github.sha }}"
      - run: echo "${{ github.ref }}"
```

You can also use [expression syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions) to do comparisons, or to manipulate a given context/variable:

```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "${{ github.sha + ' ola' }}"
      # Example: it will output 'GitHub SHA: 80910396b2df0f055442575dc109f856edfbc24b ola'
```

---

### GitHub Actions - Variables

You can set variables either at runtime or at the start of the workflow, that might be useful to conditionally branch the _workflow_ or to get information from APIs:

```yaml
# defining variables in a static way
env:
  DAY_OF_WEEK: Wednesday
jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      JOB_ENV: Hello world!
    steps:
      - run: echo "$JOB_ENV It's $DAY_OF_WEEK"
      # It will output  'Hello world! It's Wednesday'
      - run: echo "${{ env.JOB_ENV }} It's ${{ env.DAY_OF_WEEK }}"
      # You can also use contexts to access them. I personally prefer contexts to distinguish between
      #  my variables and shell environment variables
```

---

### GitHub Actions - Setting dynamic variables

As said previously, it might be useful to set variables at runtime (for example, getting certain data from an API), by appending to `$GITHUB_ENV`:

```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
    run-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "JOB_ENV='Hello world!'" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      - run: echo "$JOB_ENV"
      # it will output 'Hello world!"
```

**NOTE:** `JOB_ENV` will only be accessible inside the job `job1`

---

### GitHub Actions - Matrix Strategy

Imagine you need to run tests on all your supported platforms (e.g.: `windows`, `linux`, and `macos`). It's not very productive to duplicate the _workflow_ file 3 times therefore you can use matrices to create _workflow runs_ on a combination of variables:

```yaml
jobs:
  example_matrix:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        version: [10, 12, 14]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.version }}
```

The matrix strategy will create **all combinations** of the variables (in this case this run will have 6 different configurations). This has a maximum of 256 combinations.

---

### GitHub Actions - Secrets

_Secrets_ allow you to have _workflows_ that can handle **sensitive** information (e.g.: API keys, private keys, etc...). You can only read secrets that you **explicitly** include. You should avoid passing _secrets_ between processes and jobs in your _workflow_ because you might be vulnerable to a **supply-chain attack** (like the xz incident).

You should pass secrets using the **with** keyword in Actions or printing them on **STDIN** of a process. If you wish to pass it as an argument you must do it indirectly:

```yaml

jobs:
  job1:
    env:
      SUPER_DUPER_SECRET_KEY: "${{ secrets.SUPER_DUPER_SECRET_KEY }}"
    steps:
      - run: |
        echo "$SUPER_DUPER_SECRET_KEY" | some-process
  job2:
    steps:
      run: echo "$SUPER_DUPER_SECRET_KEY"
    # will return nothing because it's scoped to the first job
```

---

### GitHub Actions - Caching

It might be useful to speed up the _workflow_ by caching dependencies between workflow jobs. This improves developer experience but also can reduce costs (if running on paid runners):

- `setup-python`, `setup-node`, `setup-java`, `setup-ruby`, etc... These are community actions that set the right environment for your desired language but also can cache dependencies automatically;
- `cache` action is a generalized caching action that takes a list of paths and caches them with an explicit `key` for a cache entry. [Documentation](https://github.com/actions/cache).

```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
    steps:
      - name: Cache Files
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        id: cache-files
        with:
          path:
            - foo/
            - bar
          # caches by OS but also caches by current git ref
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ github.ref }}
      - if: steps.cache-files.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
        run: ./create-files.sh
```

---

### GitHub Actions - Artifacts

You sometimes wish to store files after a _job_/_workflow_ has been completed (e.g.: you have a workflow that builds an application but, you need the output to another workflow that deploys the new version).

This is different from caching because caching is used when something is not changed often. However, artifacts are used when you want to save files like binaries or build logs. These are persisted, by default, for 90 days.

```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
    steps:
      - name: Upload final apk
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: final-apk-build
          path: output/output.apk
  job2:
    needs: job1
    steps:
      - name: Download a .apk
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: final-apk-build
```

### Examples from NIAEFEUP

Sometimes the best way to learn is by looking at how the community implements CI/CD, these are some of our examples:

- [UNI workflows](https://github.com/NIAEFEUP/uni/tree/develop/.github/workflows)
- [New Website frontend workflows](https://github.com/NIAEFEUP/website-niaefeup-frontend/tree/develop/.github/workflows)
- [New Website backend workflows](https://github.com/NIAEFEUP/website-niaefeup-backend/tree/develop/.github/workflows)

# Hands-on

### I hope that wasn't too overwhelming üòÖ

---

### Next steps

You should create a new repository that is a template of this repo:

<div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: space-between; height:15rem">
  <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center">
    <a href="https://github.com/NIAEFEUP/workshop-sinf-2024-ci-cd">https://github.com/NIAEFEUP/workshop-sinf-2024-ci-cd</a>
  </div>

  <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center">
    <img src="assets/template.png">
  </div>
</div>

**NOTE:** you should create it as a public repository because this way you don't waste your precious free minutes.

---

### Developing locally

You can use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act), which is a tool that allows you to run GitHub Action _workflows_ locally using _docker_. However, this is not 100% accurate and some things might not work on the GitHub runners.

I recommend creating a new branch for testing and committing and pushing every change. However, you might not want to have too many commits on your PR so you can amend the last commit and force push it:

```sh
git commit -a --amend && git push --force
```

# Thank you!

## Any questions?
