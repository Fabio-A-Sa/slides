# HTTP
## Holy-sh*t, This Title Pops

--

### No, but really
### .highlight[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]

---

# HTTP

HTTP is a protocol used to communicate between two machines, currently used in web applications.

In a simple form:

1. Client makes a request
1. Server receives and handles the request
1. Server sends a response
1. You get to see cats on your screen

---

# HTTP

![](./img/http.jpg)

---

# HTTP Methods

HTTP has many methods, so we'll only show the most common:

* `GET` Usually used to .highlight[read] or fetch resources. Should not have secondary effects on the server.
* `POST` Usually used to interact with a resource, often causing a change in state or .highlight[side-effects].
* `PUT` Usually used to .highlight[create/replace] entities. Should be idempotent - No matter how many times you call it, the result is the same.
* `PATCH` Usually used to apply partial .highlight[updates] to a resource.
* `DELETE` Usually used to .highlight[delete] a resource.


---

# HTTP Status

Each HTTP Response has an associated Status code.

* .dense[`1XX`] Information
* .dense[`2XX`] Success
* .dense[`3XX`] Redirects
* .dense[`4XX`] Client error
* .dense[`5XX`] Server error

Check out https://http.cat !

---

# HTTP Status

Some examples:

* .dense[`201 Created`] After a successful creation of a resource
* .dense[`301 Moved Permanently`] Useful for crawlers to know when a webpage has been moved to another location
* .dense[`401 Unauthorized`] Requires authentication to access the resource
* .dense[`404 Not Found`] The requested resource does not exist
* .dense[`418 I'm a teapot`] An HTTP easter-egg
* .dense[`503 Service Unavailable`] The server is not ready to handle the request. Maybe it's under heavy load, or undergoing maintenance

---

# API

API (Application Programming Interface) is the specification of methods through which you can interact with a service. Often web applications use REST APIs.

Some common public APIs:
* Google Maps API https://maps.googleapis.com
* Twitter API https://api.twitter.com
* NIJobs API https://ni.fe.up.pt/nijobs/api

---

# HTTP web server applications

> The server will receive the request and handle it

Web applications are simply programs that listen for requests and send responses, using the HTTP protocol.

Almost any language has its version of an http server module.

The most common are Java, Python, C# and Node.js.

Today, we'll look specifically into .highlight[Node.js]

# Node.js
## Why was the JavaScript developer sad?
### Because he didn't .highlight[Node] how to .highlight[Express] himself

---

# Node.js

.highlight[Node.js] is a server-side language that uses V8 JavaScript engine, which means you can use (almost) the same language you have to use on the browser, but now on the server as well!

.center[
```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    res.write('Hello World!'); // write a response to the client
    res.end(); // end the response
});

server.listen(80); //the server listens on port 80 (HTTP default)
```
]

---

# npm

.highlight[npm] is the package manager for Node.js. The basic commands you need to know are:

.dense[
```bash
# Bootstraps the project, creating the package.json
npm init
```
]

.dense[
```bash
# Adds a dependency to package.json and installs it locally 
npm install <package>
```
]

.dense[
```bash
# Runs a command as defined in the `scripts` section on package.json
npm run <cmd>
```
]

# React
## What is it, really?

---
class: middle
# React

.highlight[React] is a .highlight[JavaScript] library that automatically renders and handles component updates on a `<div>` of your website. 

.center[
```javascript
ReactDOM.render(
    <App />,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```
]

---
class: middle

# React

This allows it to run .highlight[__wherever__] inside an existing website. You can even migrate progressively from old UIs to React-powered UI components. 

React is just glorified JavaScript. .highlight[__Always keep this in mind!__] Most of the problems you'll face are just JavaScript problems.

To use React, you just need to load it in a `script` tag in your HTML.
<!-- , then you can use all of its functionalities. -->

---

# React in an HTML page

# React is only the View

In a typical web application, you have 3 layers:

* .highlight[**Data Layer**] - Stores the data of the application (Users, posts, comments, etc...).
* .highlight[**Logical Layer**] - Manages the interactions between the View Layer and the Data Layer (An HTTP API for example).
* .highlight[**View Layer**] - The page that is visible to users and with which they can interact.

---

##### React is designed to only be used in the .highlight[**View Layer**].

# Declarative vs Imperative Paradigms


In .highlight[**Imperative**] programming, you define exactly what will be done and .highlight[**how**].

In .highlight[**Declarative**] programming, you define what happens depending on some .highlight[**state**].

---
class: middle
# Imperative Programming

.center[
```javascript
function markSelected(id) {
    const item = document.getElementById(id);
    item.classList.add("selected");
}

Array.from(document.getElementsByClassName("todo-item"))
    .forEach(elem => elem.addEventListener("click", markSelected(elem.id)))

```
]

---

# Declarative Programming (in React)

.center[
```javascript

const [items, setItems] = useState([{isSelected: false, text: "TODO1"}])

const toggleItemSelection = (i) => {
    setItems((items) => {
        const updatedItems = cloneDeep(items);
        updatedItems[i].isSelected = !items[i].isSelected
        return updatedItems
    });
}

items.map((item, i) => (
    <p 
        className={item.isSelected && "selected"}
        onClick={toggleItemSelection(i)}
    >
        {item.text}
    </p>
))

# Context Sum up

* React is .highlight[**NOT**] a website maker.
* There are no "React websites". There are websites that .highlight[**USE**] React.
* This is why React is a library and not a framework.
* React uses .highlight[**declarative programming**] to design the interface components, making them rely on a .highlight[**state**], instead of requiring you to specify exactly how they should modify themselves. React handles the DOM changes for you :)

---

# React Theory

## Now it will start to make sense, I hope

---

# JSX

React uses an .highlight[**HTML-in-JS language (JSX)**] that lets you specify the components similarly to how you would do it in regular HTML.

.center[
```html
<div className="meteorolgy-widget">
<p>{"This is Javascript. " + "Today it's " + getMeteoPrediction()}</p>
{
    weeklyPredictions.map(prediction => (
        <p>{prediction.day + " - " + prediction.state}</p>
    ))
}
</div>
```
]

There are some differences like using `className` instead of `class`, and allowing you to have JavaScript sections to generate some parts of it.

---

# Components

React is based on a .highlight[**tree of components**], recursively rendered: a component can render none or multiple children, which will be other components, which will be rendered themselves, and so on.

.center[
```javascript
const NewsWebpage = ({news, ads}) => (
    <> // Special "dummy" component - React.Fragment
        <NewsArea news={news}/>
        <AdsColumn ads={ads}>
    </>
)
```
]

### .center[.highlight[Good Practice:] Create .highlight[small] and .highlight[simple] components, responsible for the minimum possible logic]

---
class: middle
# Components - Props

Components can receive a `props` object to use when creating the rendering logic, in order to change dynamically.

Components always have a `children` prop representing their children components.

---
# Components - Props


.center.dense-wide[
```html
const WrapperThatAddsAnHelloV1 = (props) => (
    <>
        <p>Hello,</p>
        <p>{props.name}</p>
    </>
)

const WrapperThatAddsAnHelloV2 = (props) => (
    <>
        <p>Hello,</p>
        {props.children}
    </>
)

const MyPage = () => (
    <>
        <WrapperThatAddsAnHelloV1 name="World"/>
        <WrapperThatAddsAnHelloV2>
            <p>World</p>
        </WrapperThatAddsAnHelloV2>
    </>
)
```
]

---

# DOM and VDOM

.highlight[**DOM (Document Object Model)**] is the browser's representation of a web page.
.center[
```html
<html>
    <head>
      <title>DOM</title>
    </head> 
    <body>
        <p>Hello World</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
]

React has the concept of the .highlight[**Virtual DOM**], which it stores internally to manage the components' state.

---
class: middle

# VDOM

Virtual DOM  as it only updates the relevant components instead of the whole page when rendering components in the browser.

<br>

### .highlight[**Reconciliation Phase**]

When the VDOM changes, those are mapped to instructions to update the real DOM (.highlight[**append**], .highlight[**delete**] and .highlight[**update**] operations). These instructions are generated by comparing the new version of the VDOM with the older one, and generating the minimum set of operations required to change it on the DOM*.

<br>

###### * This is a known problem for which state-of-the-art algorithms have a complexity in the order of O(n^3), n being the number of tree elements.

---
class: middle
# Reconciliation Optimizations

If we used this in React, displaying .highlight[**1000 elements**] would require in the order of .highlight[**one billion comparisons**]. This is far too expensive. Instead, React implements a heuristic O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions:

* Two elements of different types will produce different trees.
* The developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop.

---

# Reconciliating Lists

By default, when recursing on the children of a DOM node, React just iterates over both lists of children at the same time and generates a mutation whenever there‚Äôs a difference.

For example, when adding an element at the end of the children, converting between these two trees works well:

.center[.dense[
```html
<ul> <!-- before -->
  <li>first</li>
  <li>second</li>
</ul>
<ul> <!-- after -->
  <li>first</li>
  <li>second</li>
  <li>third</li>
</ul>
```
]]
React will match the two `<li>first</li>` trees, match the two `<li>second</li>` trees, and then insert the `<li>third</li>` tree.

---

# Reconciliating Lists

If you implement it naively, inserting an element at the beginning has worse performance. For example, converting between these two trees works poorly:

.center[.dense[
```html
<ul> <!-- before -->
  <li>Duke</li>
  <li>Villanova</li>
</ul>
<ul><!-- after -->
  <li>Connecticut</li>
  <li>Duke</li>
  <li>Villanova</li>
</ul>
```
]]

React will mutate every child instead of realizing it can keep the `<li>Duke</li>` and `<li>Villanova</li>` subtrees intact. This inefficiency can be a problem.

---

# Keys

In order to solve this issue, React supports a .highlight[**key**] attribute. When children have keys, React uses the key to match children in the original tree with children in the subsequent tree. For example, adding a key to our inefficient example above can make the tree conversion efficient:

.center[.dense[
```html
<ul>
  <li key="2015">Duke</li>
  <li key="2016">Villanova</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li key="2014">Connecticut</li>
  <li key="2015">Duke</li>
  <li key="2016">Villanova</li>
</ul>
```
]]

Now React knows that the element with key '2014' is the new one, and the elements with the keys '2015' and '2016' have just moved.

---
class: middle

# Keys

Usually, React will let you know when you have some list of mutating children and you should be using keys. 

But there are some things to consider before choosing your keys:

* They must be .highlight[**unique**] among the elements of the same list.
* They must be .highlight[**constant**] during the life of the element on the list.

---
class:middle                                                                                                        
# Component Lifecycle

In order to interact with the Virtual DOM, React lets you use .highlight[**React Components**], which can be .highlight[**classes**] or .highlight[**functions**] (we‚Äôll use functions) that represent a part of the website and can contain more components inside them.

These React Components are .highlight[**bound**] by a .highlight[**Lifecycle**] that manages their existence and interactions, which reflect on the actual DOM after the .highlight[**Reconciliation Phase**].

---

# Component Lifecycle

There are 4 steps:  

* .highlight[**Mounting**] **(When the component is first added to the DOM)**: 
    * The methods and events that take place here happen as the component is mounted in the DOM.
* .highlight[**Updating**] **(When the state or one of the props change, or if parent re-renders*)**: 
    * Here the methods and events take place after the React component has entered the DOM.
* .highlight[**Un-mounting**]: 
    * Here the methods and events take place as they React component leaves the DOM or is unmounted from the DOM.
* .highlight[**Error Boundaries**]: 
    * This is a special category that deals with handling or gracefully catching errors in order not to totally break your React application render.


###### * Might not happen if the child component is memoized with React.memo(), for example.

---

# React Hooks

React .highlight[**Hooks**] are JavaScript .highlight[**functions**] that can interact with the component, by executing specific actions during the component lifecycle.

React exposes some default hooks, but you can create custom hooks which call React's ones for more complex scenarios.

There are two rules when using React Hooks:

* ### .highlight[Only Call Hooks at the Top Level] 
    * Don‚Äôt call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function.
* ### .highlight[Only Call Hooks from React Functions]
Don‚Äôt call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. Instead, you can:
    * Call Hooks from React function components.
    * Call Hooks from custom Hooks

---

# Common React Hooks

### .highlight[useState(initialState)]
Let's you store some state in-between re-renders. If you pass a function as the initial value, it will only run it on the first render.

Returns an array where the first value is the state value and the second is a setter function for that value.

It's recommended you have a separate state for every variable you want to store, instead of a giant object with a field for each.

.center[.dense[
```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

const incrementCounter = () => {
    setCount(count + 1)
}

const decrementCounter = () => {
    setCount(currentCount => currentCount - 1)
}
```
]]

---
class: middle
# Common React Hooks

### .highlight[useState(initialState):] `setState(val)` vs `setState(fn)`

Using the .highlight[**function version**] is .highlight[**better**] due to async updates. If you call `incrementCounter` in rapid succession, React will batch the updates and race conditions may prevent the counter from updating multiple times, i.e. the `count` variable will not update in between calls.

Using an updater function, the "current state" variable is always correct.

---
class: middle
# Common React Hooks

### .highlight[useEffect(fn, [...dependencies])]

Lets you execute code at different stages of the lifecycle. It is .highlight[**called at every render**], but it might do nothing, depending on the dependencies.

.center[
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    // This will run on every render
})
```
]

Notice the .highlight[**undefined**] dependency array. This is the same as not calling `useEffect`, and writing the code directly on the component.

---
class: middle
# Common React Hooks

### .highlight[useEffect(fn, [...dependencies])]

.center[
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    // This will run on mount only
}, [])
```
]

Notice the .highlight[**empty**] dependency array, indicating that the code will run .highlight[**at mount only**].

---

# Common React Hooks

### .highlight[useEffect(fn, [...dependencies])]

.center[
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    // This will run every time the dependencies change
    console.log(foo, bar)
}, [foo, bar])

```
]
`foo` and `bar` might be some component props or variables created inside the component that depend on props. If the props change, making `foo` or `bar` change, the `useEffect` function will be executed.

Does .highlight[**NOT**] execute if the .highlight[**references**] to the dependencies don‚Äôt change.

---

# Common React Hooks

### .highlight[useRef(initialValue)]

`useRef` is similar to `useState`, however it does .highlight[**NOT trigger**] anything .highlight[**on change**]. It's just a mutable JavaScript object with a current field which stores whatever.

It's also used to store references to DOM elements, so that you can program something .highlight[**imperatively**], if needed.

.center[.dense[
```javascript
function TextInputWithFocusButton() {
    const inputEl = useRef(null);
    const onButtonClick = () => {
        inputEl.current.focus();  // `current` points to the mounted text input
    };
    return (
        <>
            <input ref={inputEl} type="text" />
            <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Focus the input</button>
        </>
    );
}
```
]]

---

# Custom React Hooks

We can create a function that calls any React Hook and call it as if it were a React Hook, for more complex scenarios.

.center[
```javascript
function useForm(fieldOptions) {
    const initialState = Object.entries(fieldOptions).map(...)
    const [fields, setFields] = useState(initialState)

    const setField = (fieldName) = (val) => {
        setFields(fields => ({
            ...fields,
            [fieldName]: val
        }))
    }

    return [fields, setField];
}
```
]

# Common libraries/API that you must know

---

# PropTypes

Since React is programmed in JavaScript, props .highlight[**DON'T**] have types by default. This can lead to some errors if you're not careful.

.highlight[**PropTypes**] lets you define the types for you component props, and even if they are required or not.

.center[
```javascript
const SomeComponent = ({prop1, prop2, prop3}) => ()

SomeComponent.propTypes = {
    prop1: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    prop2: PropTypes.func,
    prop3: PropTypes.oneOf(["first", "second", "third"]).isRequired,
}
```
]

---

# Calling APIs - Fetch

In order to make requests to an HTTP API, you can use the built-in JS library .highlight[**fetch**], or some external package such as .highlight[**Axios**].

.center[
```javascript
try {
        const response = await fetch(`${API_HOSTNAME}/offers`, {
            method: "GET",
        });
        
        if (!response.ok) {
            // Any HTTP status non 2xx will make ok = false
        }
        
        // If the response is JSON, call .json() which returns a Promise
        const json = await res.json();

    } catch (error) {
        // Handle Network Error
}
```
]

---

# React Router

React Router allows you to .highlight[**simulate**] different pages in your application.

.center[
```html
<BrowserRouter>
    <Switch>
        <Route
            exact
            path="/"
        >
            <HomePage/>
        </Route>
        <Route
            path="/apply/company"
        >
            <CompanyApplicationPage/>
        </Route>
    </Switch>
</BrowserRouter>
```
]

---
class: middle
# React Router

When you .highlight[**define different Routes**], technically, it will .highlight[**NOT create different pages**]. The user will still access "/", which will then load the application code and then the rest of the path will be parsed and a different component will be rendered, depending on the route.

This is why when you have an .highlight[**"only React with React Router"**] web application, you need to re-route all pages to "/", so that they are resolved by React, instead of the web server itself.

# Redux

.highlight[**Redux**] allows you to .highlight[**centralize your application's state and logic**] enables powerful capabilities like .highlight[**undo/redo**] and .highlight[**state persistence**].

Redux is made for JavaScript in general, but it has specific bindings for React, which are really useful.

# REST to the RESCue

REST (Representational State Transfer) uses HTTP Status and URI rules to give meaning to calls and represent resources and operations.

Instead of .dense[`GET /getStock?beverageType=water`]

we have .dense[`GET /beverages/water/stock`]

<hr>

<div class="flex-columns">
<div>
Instead of 
.sparse[
```bash
POST /buy
{
    beverageType: water,
    quantity: 2,
    paymentMethod: {
        type: "credit-card",
        id: "1111-1111-1111-1111"
        ...
    }
}
```
]
</div>

<div>
we have
.sparse[
```bash
POST /water/buy
{
    quantity: 2,
    paymentMethod: {
        type: "credit-card",
        id: "1111-1111-1111-1111"
        ...
    }
}
```
]
</div>
</div>

# REST

REST focuses on **Resources** and **Operations**, instead of behaviors. You don't call functions. You don't even know which functions exist. Only need to know about resources, and what you can do with those.

Often, the same URL is used but, by changing the HTTP Method, it gives a completely different meaning:

.dense[
```bash
POST /posts/new # Creates a new post
```
]

.dense[
```bash
GET /posts/new # Fetches the latest posts
```
]

# Express

.highlight[Express] is a .highlight[web framework] that abstracts some of the work involved in creating a web server in Node.js. It offers us neat feature like .highlight[**routing**] and .highlight[**middleware**], which we'll see later on.

.center[
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 80;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
})
```
]

---

# Why don't we just use Node.js?

Here's how a simple server would look like in Node.js:

.center[
```javascript
const server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    const endpoint = req.url;

    if(endpoint == '/') {
        res.write('hello world');
    } else if(endpoint == '/bruno'){
        res.write('hello Bruno');
    } else if(endpoint == '/joao'){
        res.write('hello Jo√£o');
    } else {
        res.write('hello stranger');
    }

    res.end();
});
```
]

---

Let's now try to use "parameters"

.center[
```javascript
const server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    const endpoint = req.url;
    const params = endpoint.split('/'); // Are these really parameters?

    // What if we have something like /bruno/goodbye?
    if (params.length > 1) {
        const name = params[1];
        res.write(`hello ${name}`);
    } else {
        res.write('hello world');
    }

    res.end();
});
```
]

---

We're expecting `/:name`, we need to make sure we don't affect other endpoints!

.center[
```javascript
const server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    const endpoint = req.url;
    const params = endpoint.split('/'); // Are these really parameters?

    if (params.length > 2) { // Can you actually scale this?
        res.writeHead(StatusCodes.NOT_FOUND);
        res.write("The opereration is not supported");
    } else if (params.length == 1) {
        const name = params[1];
        res.write(`hello ${name}`);
    } else {
        res.write('hello world');
    }

    res.end();
});
```
]

---

What about error handling? I think you're starting to see the problem...

.center[
```javascript
const server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    const endpoint = req.url;
    const params = endpoint.split('/'); // Are these really parameters?

    if (params.length > 2) { // Can you actually scale this?
        res.writeHead(StatusCodes.NOT_FOUND);
        res.write("The opereration is not supported");
    } else if (params.length == 1) {
        const name = params[1];
        if (typeof name == 'string') {
            if (name == "andre") {
                res.writeHead(StatusCodes.FORBIDDEN);
                res.write('You were banned from our website!');
            }
            res.write(`hello ${params.name}`);
        } else {
            res.writeHead(StatusCodes.BAD_REQUEST);
            res.write('Invalid name!');
        }
    } else {
        res.write('hello world');
    }

    res.end();
});
```
]

---

## Node.js + Express.js = ‚ù§Ô∏è

.center[
```javascript
function validName(req, res, next) {
    if (typeof req.params.name != 'string') {
        res.status(StatusCodes.BAD_REQUEST).send('Invalid name!');
        return;
    }
    next();
}

function isNameForbidden(req, res, next) {
    if (req.params.name == 'andre') {
        res.status(StatusCodes.FORBIDDEN).send('You were banned from our website!');
        return;
    }
    next();
}

app.get('/:name', validName, isNameForbidden, (req, res) => {
    res.send(`Hello ${req.params.name}!`);
})

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!'))
```
]

---

# Routing

*Routing* is how an application responds to a client request to a particular .highlight[endpoint] (URI) and request .highlight[method] (GET, POST, etc.).

.center[
```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.post('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Got a POST request')
})

app.put('/user', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Got a PUT request at /user')
})

app.delete('/user', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Got a DELETE request at /user')
})
```
]

---

# Route Parameters

You can think about Route Parameters as .highlight[variables] lying in the URL itself. The values are stored in the .highlight[req.params] object, with the name specified in the path as the key.

.center[
```javascript
app.get('/:name', (req, res) => {
    res.send(`Hello ${req.params.name}!`);
})
```
]

There are more ways of handling route paths, like regex and wildcards. You can read about them [here](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html).

Query parameters, such as `/?name=bob`, are also common and stored in the .highlight[req.query] object.

---

# Multiple Routers

In order to have a modular application, we can use multiple routers. You can think of a router as a .highlight[mini-app].
You have two ways of doing this:

<div class="flex-columns">

.center[
```javascript
app.route('/book')
  .get((req, res) => {
    res.send('Get a random book');
  })
  .post((req, res) => {
    res.send('Add a book');
  })
  .put((req, res) => {
    res.send('Update the book');
  })
```
]

.center[
```javascript
const router = express.Router();
app.use("/book", router);

// Translates to /book/buy
router.post("/buy", (req, res) => {
    res.send("Buy a book");
});
```
]

---

# Middleware

Middleware functions run between the request arrival and the route handler, so it's useful for validation or or some logic you want to run every time you receive a request.

They have access to the .highlight[request] object (req), the .highlight[response] object (res), and the .highlight[next] function. .highlight[next] is a special function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current one.

.center[
```javascript
function isNameForbidden(req, res, next) {
    if (req.params.name == 'andre') {
        res.status(StatusCodes.FORBIDDEN).send('You were banned!');
        return;
    }
    next();
}

app.get('/:name', validName, isNameForbidden, (req, res) => {
    res.send(`Hello ${req.params.name}!`);
})
```
]

---

# Error Handling

You can define error-handling functions the same way as other middleware functions, except with four arguments instead of three: .highlight[err], .highlight[req], .highlight[res], and .highlight[next].

You can use .highlight[app.use()] to define a global middleware, including an error handler.

.center[
```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack)
  res.status(StatusCodes.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).send('Something broke!')
})
```
]

---

# Response Methods

The .highlight[res] object has a lot of methods for sending responses to the client. Here are some of the most common ones:

* .highlight[res.send()] - Sends a response of any type.
* .highlight[res.json()] - Sends a JSON response.
* .highlight[res.status()] - Sets the status code of the response.
* .highlight[res.redirect()] - Redirects the request to another URL.
* .highlight[res.sendFile()] - Sends a file.

You can read more about them [here](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html). 

---

# Express Validators

Express has a package called .highlight[express-validator] that can be used to validate the request body, params, query, headers, and cookies.

.center[
```javascript
const { body, validationResult } = require('express-validator');

app.post('/user',
  body('email').isEmail(), // must be an email
  body('password').isLength({ min: 5 }), // must be at least 5 chars long
  async (req, res) => {
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
      return res.status(StatusCodes.BAD_REQUEST).json({ errors: errors.array() });
    }

    const user = await User.create(
        {email: req.body.email, password: req.body.password});
    res.json(user);
  },
);
```
]

---

# Express Validators

There are a lot of available validators, you can check them [here](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/).

* .highlight[isString()] - Checks if the value is a string.
* .highlight[notEmpty()] - Checks if the value is not empty.
* .highlight[custom(validator)] - Checks if the value passes a custom function.
* .highlight[withMessage(message)] - Adds a custom error message.
* .highlight[bail()] - Stops the validation chain if the current validator fails.
* .highlight[optional()] - Marks the current validation chain as optional.

.center[
```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "location": "body",
      "msg": "Invalid value",
      "param": "email"
    }
  ]
}
```
]

---

# Body Parser

You'll often want to develop an API that accepts .highlight[JSON] data (or another format). In order to do that, you need to parse the request body.

Before Express 4.16.0, you needed to install a package called .highlight[body-parser] to parse the request body as JSON. Now, you can simply use the .highlight[express.json()] method.

.center[
```javascript
app.use(express.json());
```
]

# CORS
## Currently Out of Rad Subtitles

### No, but really
### .highlight[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing]

---

# CORS

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell a browser to let a web application running at one origin (domain) have permission to access selected resources from a server at a different origin.

Due to this, you **cannot** make requests to services in different locations by default. This is the most common error for beginner web developers.
